# Writing Pack

## Scope

Use for drafting, editing, style, structure, publication copy, documentation prose, and tone control.

## Load When

- User asks to write, rewrite, summarize, translate, or edit text.
- The task has a target audience, voice, format, or publication surface.

## Rules

1. Identify audience, purpose, and target surface before rewriting.
2. Preserve factual meaning unless the user asks for content changes.
3. Keep terminology consistent with project docs.
4. Mark uncertain claims instead of inventing support.
5. Do not bury durable requirements only in prose; use project index, spec, runbook, or handoff when needed.
6. For public Traditional Chinese docs or HTML aimed at non-technical readers, use steady written Chinese. Keep English only for commands, paths, URLs, file names, product names, and unavoidable tool names. Avoid mixed half-English fragments, internal governance codes, and developer-only wording in reader-facing prose.
7. For public README, onboarding, and other user-facing docs, use the product-journey rule: the user states the goal, the AI handles technical work. Keep one primary user path. Do not make users choose between install, upgrade, doctor, dry-run, or terminal commands when an AI-assisted path exists. Put technical commands in the dedicated AI install page, CLI help, or advanced examples instead of duplicating them in the main README flow.
8. When writing or revising Markdown files, decide whether the output is a durable source, a reference, a runbook, a public document, a reusable generated artifact, a draft, or one-time evidence. Durable outputs must be indexed or tied to a registered source/sync home before completion; drafts and one-time evidence must be labeled so they do not become hidden current state.
9. If a new document repeats requirements, instructions, acceptance rules, or process already owned by another file, consolidate into the existing source or make the new file explicitly subordinate. Do not let writing work create parallel truth.
10. Before changing public-facing product copy, read `docs/公開文案語氣規格.md` and preserve its accepted README tone: plain user value first, no internal task framing, and infographics treated as a core deliverable.

## Checks

- Verify requested format, language, and tone.
- Check links, commands, names, and version-sensitive claims when relevant.
- Check `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md` if public docs or user-facing instructions changed.
- For any Markdown file created or materially changed, check whether `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md` needs a Directory Map, Fact Base, Entry Points, or read-condition update.
- Check duplicate-source risk before keeping a new requirement, checklist, process, or instruction document.
- For public Chinese docs, read the final text as a new user journey: the next action should be clear without technical background.
- For README-style docs, confirm the main path does not become parallel instructions: no repeated manual install section, no competing command table, and no requirement that the reader understand internal files before taking the first action.
- For public product copy, confirm `docs/公開文案語氣規格.md` was applied: the copy explains what the tool helps the user do, mentions infographics when describing product capability, and avoids internal / AI-sounding phrasing.

## Closeout

Record changed documents, unresolved content questions, and any sync or follow-up needed.
